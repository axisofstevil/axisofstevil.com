National Triumph Week was established in 1976, as a week long celebration of all the victories you, as an indvidual, have. Founded by [Billy Carter](http://axisofstevil.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/billycarter1977poster.jpg "Billy Carter"), NTW has come a great ways from humble beginnings. The 1st national triumph week was held to honor of the Ford Pinto; a marvel at the time in gas tank car chassey placement. Since then the holiday has grown in popularity and scope. It became a hot bed of controversy in the late 90s when it was officially declared a pseudo-holiday in the April Editon of TIME magazine. TIME received over 740 thousand pieces of mail regarding the story. All but 13 of them praised and rejoiced about the Holiday. Those 13 troubled souls came together and demanded a retraction and apology. The "UnNTW-13", as they are so commonly called, was established in May 1998. This group of 13 people banded together to form a committee who mission it was to never let NTW be celebrated. In June 1998, suspiciously 12 of the 13 members dissappeared and later it was discovered in 1999 that the [13th became a warrior](http://axisofstevil.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/13thwarrior.jpg "13th became a warrior") and fought many people in battle re-enactments in front of a motion picture camera. With all negative backlash surrounding this holiday disbanded, The Axis of Stevil knew exactly what to do, BRING ON THE TRIUMPH!

This week (April 3rd - April 9th) marks the new beginnings of this time-honored tradition. This week, The Axis of Stevil is asking you to celebrate all of your victories over life, triumphs over social dilemmas, acheivement in the face of dis-acheivement. Stand up tall and be proud for yourself, your country and your banana weigh station attendant, without him you would still be guessing how much banana is in a bunch of bananas. Get out there and show the world what you are made of.

## Triumphant Return Of The American Spirit

The Axis of Stevil, while a powerhouse player in international affairs and business, is at its core an American corporation. This National Triumph Week, The Axis of Stevil is taking the initiative and hailing for the Triumphant Return of the American Spirit [TRAS].

The modern American spirit was conceived in the 1950s and truly came into its own in the mid to late 1960s. The American spirit is the quality of being good at two things: work and the pursuit of happiness. With these two things, Americans can accomplish anything they can set their mind to. It was this mentality that made America the best thing going since Constantinople.

In recent memory, and entirely with out approval from The Axis of Stevil, the American spirit has faded and been [transmogrified](http://axisofstevil.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/transmogrifier.gif "transmogrified") into an entirely different creature. The American spirit now is a dichotomy of self-loathing and self-gratification; two states of mind not endorsed by the Axis of Stevil. The modern American spirit has lead a part of this nation into a downward spiral of incompetence, short sightedness, greed, fear and doubt. This spirit breeds weak skinned Americans that feel shameful for their success, their independent thoughts and the basic freedoms that generations before them struggled for.

The Axis of Stevil can no longer sit idly by and watch. The TRAS Initiative is a public out reach program set on re-educating the country on what it is to be American. The correct and powerful American spirit is being infused back into neighborhoods and communities across the country. The Axis of Stevil encourages everyone to work hard and seek their dreams.

With the Axis of Stevil holdings equaling 20% of GDP, The Axis of Stevil expects to see the execution and completion of the TRAS Initiative to the fullest extent, therefore The Axis of Stevil offers as an aid to the eternal vigilance, these custom Patriotic Wallpapers.
