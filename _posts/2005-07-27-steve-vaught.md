## STEVE VAUGHT ##

![Stevevaught1][id_1]

Hero. The one word that is capable of cutting your elderly neighbors grass, standing up to the school bully, putting a smile on a sadface and being the 11th caller in a radio contest for Mike Doughty tickets for the September 15th show. Hero is defined as an ordinary person, noted for feats of courage or nobility of purpose, especially those who have risked or sacrificed their lives. Hero. What does the word mean to you?

If you ask the Vaught family in Southern California, the answer you will undoubtedly receive will be Steve Vaught. Born Stephen James Liller in Youngstown, Ohio, he is the head of the Vaught household and is a self proclaimed [fatkid](/p/fatkid "fatkid"). Distraught about his suffering emotional health and current weight conditions, Steve felt victimized by his life and feared its early demise. He felt something was missing and he didn’t have power to overcome the powerful adversary. After a long life of education, serving his country and raising a family, it was time for Steve to take back his life and become his own personal hero.

On April 10th 2005, Steve set off to accomplish that mission by becoming The Fat Man Walking. It was on that day that he began his nationwide walk for losing weight and regaining his life. With six months time, his family’s blessing and very little money, Steve took on the heavy challenges that threatened his success, but still pushed through saying “*I need to change the behaviors that have allowed me to be in this situation in the first place.*”

With remarkable courage, Steve still walks tall each day and takes the road to personal health and self worth one step at a time. Bound and determined, Steve Vaught deserves The Axis of Stevil's utmost respect and praises. His victory in this struggle is sure to be marked in the history books.

Steve started thefatmanwalking.com to display his mission, photographs and progress. By documenting his journey, Steve serves as a guide and goal for anybody battling similar odds, or situations, to use in their own search for answers of life. As of July 26th, 2005. Steve is proudly heading to Winslow, AZ. Good Luck Steve! You are an inspiration to this universe of [fatkids](/p/fatkid "fatkids") and you have the full support of The Axis of Stevil.
