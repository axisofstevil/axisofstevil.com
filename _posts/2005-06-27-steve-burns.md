Our tribute train rolling through Steveville makes an suprising stop this week, at the Steve Burns Station. The former host of the children’s television series Blue’s Clues snagged his job early in his career and met the "best friend a guy in a green striped shirt could ask for". Reportedly showing up for the audition in army fatigues and combat boots, Steve showed the genuine warmth and appeal required to engage the minds of children today. On the show, Steve and his canine sidekick, Blue, have regular adventures such as taking a trip to the mail box to see what exciting new tidbits of information they could discover or learning life lessons from a salt and pepper shaker. Still wildly popular at video rental stores and aired on children’s networks, Steve’s charm appeals to children of all ages.

Studies have shown that Blue’s Clues enhances the imaginations of youngsters by 67% when viewed regularly with a notepad and green crayon.

Most recently Steve has been working on a screenplay for an updated version of the Baby Sitter’s Club. The soon to be author of dramatic experiences some day hopes to settle down with a family nestled in the quiet cornucopia of stardom, Beverly Hills. The Axis of Stevil wishes the best for this charismatic and funfilled Steve.
