This illustrious company is founded on the principle that everyone can be successful and have a voice to speak their ideas, even people as plain as the name given to millions of people each year, Steve! Every so often, the Axis of Stevil takes pleasure in shining the proverbial spotlight on a Steve who shows excellence in their field.

In an ongoing effort to endorse family unity, The Axis of Stevil would like to salute you:

## THE STEVENS FAMILY ##

This week, The Axis of Stevil would like to recognize the Stevens Family. This upper middle class family lives in Sacramento California, where like any other family, they face their share of ups, downs and weird neighbors. The oldest daughter Ren is a perfectionist with a thing for sticky notes and juggling a busy schedule. Her younger brother Louis and his two best friends, Twitty and Tawny, use humor as an effective tool to fit in the over-achieving family. As mischievous as they come, their neighbor, Beans, constantly finds clever ways to sneak into the house hounding for bacon and providing the family with more than their share of distractions.

On a more memorable vacation, the Stevens Family had an encounter with the infamous Three Toed Sloth. After hours of attempts to hold a conversation with him, the family heard the only documented response by a Sloth.

"***Moose. Indian. I feel faint.***"

They then received a grant from the government, which they use today to support Sloth mites nationwide. With a last name like Stevens this family is anything but ordinary.

There will always be an open door in The Axis of Stevil's House for The Stevens Family in the [Axis of Stevil](/ "Axis of Stevil").
