In an ongoing effort to promote the success of Steves on every avenue, and educate the public about the existence of greatness outside of television or movie stardom, The Axis of Stevil shines the light of local success on Charlotte, North Carolina’s very own:

## STEVE DOBBINS ##

When writing a book about a Steve, there are many challenges you run into. Where do I begin? Is one event more important that another? How much is this pizza going to cost me? How do I discuss a father, baker, pilot, business man, pirate, and Yacht enthusiast in under 300 chapters? The best solution to moving past these problems is to lay out the facts in chronological order of occurrence. Below you will find excerpts from a book called [“Steves Can Do Anything They Put Their Mind To: The Steve Dobbins Story”](http://d3e878vmunx8cm.cloudfront.net/assets/stevedobbinsstory.jpg "“Steves Can Do Anything They Put Their Mind To: The Steve Dobbins Story”"). These selections have been carefully selected by The Axis of Stevil: Archives and Selections Committee. Enjoy!

### Chapter 1 ###
Born Steven Farrell Dobbins on April 11, 1950, the first chapter of Steve’s life begins like any other except as he enters this world, he creates a tremor in the Steve Alliance. With an objective of living life to the fullest and limitless possiblity, Steve set forth to conquer this life.

### Chapter 6 ###
Steve took the bus to school just like every ordinary day, but he knew from the snarling look Doug Peters shot across the bus at him, that this day would turn out to be far from ordinary . . .

> This is the part where we discuss Steve’s early life; Grade School, First Job, First Car, College etc. But when asked about these things, Steve addressed me with a very serious face and said “I could tell you but then, I would have to kill you.” Scared for my life, I decided to skip those parts and move on to the part of the Steve investigation that allows me to avoid water skiing in the Tar River with cement boots! On with the show . . .

. . . and after the baptism, Steve handed the baby back and said “Next time hire a real preacher.” You really are the man, Steve!

### Chapter 48 ½  ###
Shortly after, on October 16, 1976, Steve married his lovely wife, Lynda. This was a very important and special day for Steve. I was tipped off to the significance of this event by some unexplainable force. I couldn’t tell if it was something about the way he said it, his facial expression, or the fact that he knew the date right off the top of his head.

### Chapter 50 ###
Married and ambitious, and with an airplane for a pen Steve followed his heart to write the next chapter in his book. After six weeks of aircraft systems and flight training, an impressive flight resume, and six years of experience, logging over 6300 hours of flight time, Steve finally landed the job security plane on runway “0-niner-happiness”. On June 6, 1978, Piedmont Airlines made one of the smartest decisions in the history of modern aviation by hiring Steven F. Dobbins to pilot their aircraft. With another feather in his cap, Steve moved along to his next adventure.

### Chapter 68 ###
One of the greatest and most revered events in a Steve’s life is the day a child is born. Children are the heart of our future and knowing that there will always be a piece of Steve in the future is a great relief. Steve was lucky enough to experience, not one but, two of these days. His daughters were born, August Dobbins – January 18, 1980 and Ashley Dobbins – August 30, 1982. The births of his two daughters were the, hands down, happiest days of his exciting and fruit filled life.

### Chapter 204 ###
Steve loves his family and will do whatever it takes to make them happy. All in all, The Axis of Stevil believes that this is what makes anyone successful; Happiness. The more happiness you spread, the more you earn. Having met Steve and his family, I would testify that Steve truly is a great Steve and deserves to be featured on the Wall of Steves.

Steve spends his days flying airplanes, running his business (Lake Norman Charters), baking delicious chocolate cakes, and most importantly loving his family.
