This illustrious company is founded on the principle that everyone can be successful and have a voice to speak their ideas, even people as plain as the name given to millions of people each year, Steve! Every so often, the Axis of Stevil takes pleasure in shining the proverbial spotlight on a Steve who shows excellence in their field.

In an ongoing effort to promote progress, The Axis of Stevil would like to salute you:

## STEVE ZISSOU ##

This week, the Axis of Stevil would like to salute you, Steve Zissou, world renowned Oceanographer and student of the sea. Being placed under some of the most extreme conditions a man can face, Zissou always manages to keep his cool and come out on top. His team of adventurers, scientists and unpaid interns man a distinguished crew bringing them into contact with some of the most exotic creatures known to man such as the Jaguar Shark and Crayon Fish. Even a gang of pirates (or hijackers) canâ€™t keep this Steve and his crew down.

There will always be a spot for Steve Zissou in the [Axis of Stevil](/ "Axis of Stevil").
