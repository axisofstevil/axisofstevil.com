## STEVIE NICKS ##

![Stevienicks1][id_1]

Born in 1948 in Phoenix Arizona Nick's began performing at age 4 and writing her own music early in her teens. Nicks met Lindsay
Buckingham her senior year of high school when they formed their first band together, The Fritz. Touring along the west coast the band gained notoriety and in 1973 recorded a demo while also becoming involved romantically.

Despite the album's flop, the attention of the band Fleetwood Mac was caught and the Nicks and Buckingham were asked to join the group. By 1975 the band was atop the charts and 1977's Rumours, which sold over 17 million copies and stood for several years as the best-selling album of all-time.

In 1981 Nicks took some time off from the band and did solo work which includes such hits as "Dreams", "Rhiannon", and "Edge of Seventeen (Just Like the White Winged Dove)." Nick's had two other solo albums which would also see top 5 success by 1985. After a series of splits and reconciliations, Stevie Nick's rejoined Fleetwood Mac on stage in 1997 and toured for their album The Dance.

One of the most successful songwriters of this time, Stevie Nick's is a woman who is guided by her intuition. She is unable to read music, believes in angels, witches and magic wandsâ€¦and this is exactly why the Axis of Stevil adores her.

There will always be a spot for Stevie Nicks in the [Axis of Stevil](/ "Axis of Stevil").
