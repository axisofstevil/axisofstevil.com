Steves and Stevens are everywhere. Seeing so many makes it very difficult to truly recognise the great Steves. Great Steves are what hold this organization together. Without great steves this would surely fail. Every month or so we like to shine a little light on some great , lesser known Steves. They may not be an official member yet, but they still deserve a little credit for what they do.

This month, [Axis of Stevil.com](/ "Axis of Stevil.com") salutes you:

## STEVE MARTIN ##

![Stevemartin1][id_1]

AAAAAAAHH!! OH MY GOD! STEVE  MARTIN! Yes that time has come where the [Axis of Stevil](/ "Axis of Stevil") must stand up tall and tip our proverbial hats to you Steve Martin. Your cynical wit astounds us, your sensational comic presence wows us and your peculiar idiosyncrasies make us scratch our heads. Actor, Writer, Director, Producer, Comic and "Pig Eye Jackson"? A jack of all trades, a man about town, johnny on the spot, you have all the right makins to be a great Steve and then some. There will always be a spot for Steve Martin in the Axis of Stevil. His website is pretty cool too, [www.stevemartin.com](http://www.stevemartin.com "www.stevemartin.com").

Steve has been apart of many productions, infiniti plus one to be exact, including "Cheaper by the Dozen", "Bringing Down the House", "Bowfinger" and "Mixed Nuts." As well as 75plus Talk Show appearances.

Steve was born in Waco, Texas on August 4, 1945. ONE GREAT STEVE FOR MAN, ONE GIANT STEVE FOR MANKIND!
