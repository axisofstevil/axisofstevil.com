This illustrious company is founded on the principle that everyone can be successful and have a voice to speak their ideas, even people as plain as the name given to millions of people each year, Steve! Every so often, the Axis of Stevil takes pleasure in shining the proverbial spotlight on a Steve who shows excellence in their field.

In an ongoing effort to promote the telling of a great story and providing a great American legend with life, The Axis of Stevil shines its spotlight on the namesake:

## STEVE SMITH ##

What is a name? For the longest time it was believed that a name meant very little, it was a moniker given to you by your parents for means of identification. Joseph Stevenson, in his 1978 essay "String energy as it relates to family title", proposed just that.

> “The names given to us by our forefathers are ancient and mystic wells of collective unconsciousness provided to us by accident or design for purposes unknown. It is to the bearer of each unique name combination to discover it’s meanings within himself and to the brotherhood that shares the name with him”

These wells, different in strength and powers for every title, endow the bearer with unseen abilities, personalities and thoughts.

Though almost all names have an equal might, there are those names that can handicap their unfortunate bearers. One such of these is the name of Smith. The most common and un-thought-out of names, the well of Smith is near dry. Drained from every direction by the millions of people who share in its generic nature. So much force is put on the name that it acts a siphon, pulling energy from weaker Smiths; ultimately crippling the world’s populations. Thus, leaving Smith’s to waste away in obscurity and obsolesces. Such victims must rely on one of their other names for survival.

The Axis of Stevil would like to shine a spotlight on those Steve's who are implicated to the name Smith as well. The Steve Smith's of our world illustrate how a Steve's natural ability of perseverance can overcome any obstacle.

There have been many Steve Smith's, no two alike but all showing what it is to be a Steve. From extraordinary [football talent](http://www.nfl.com/players/playerpage/235157 "football talent"), to an unusual [ability of percussion](http://www.vitalinformation.com/steve/ "ability of percussion") and even an [adapted ness at reality](http://www.stevesmith.com/ "adapted ness at reality"), Steve Smiths have marched on, defining their lives of the might of Stevil. Though fate cursed them with a bipolar epitaph, their spirits, refusing to play the victim, saw through the cosmic joke and embraced Stevilization. Elevating them to seats of greatness and notoriety. 

Research of the “Save The Smiths Foundation” cites Stevil energy as one of the few saviors of the name. Steve Smiths unwittingly lose 26,350 units of Kinetic Stevil Energy to the black hole of Smith quarterly. To put it in perspective, that energy is equivalent to four Martha’s or nine Johns. This tremendous drain of the spirit would overtake almost anybody. Many, however, find this fact rewarding they better countless lives across the land by helping an underprivileged designation.
