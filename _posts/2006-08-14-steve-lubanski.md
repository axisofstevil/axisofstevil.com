In an ongoing effort to revere those who lead lives of generosity, be it to charity, community, or consort, The Axis of Stevil would like to hoppily pay homage to **Steve Lubanski**!

On August sixteenth, 1992, a charming young character named Steve Lubanksi wondered into a “Seminars for Singles” discussion group, where he met Candace Frazee. Little did these single-seekers realize that their introduction was one for the Guinness Book of World Records, for Steve Lubanski and Candace Frazee are the proud residents of the world’s largest bunny museum. Located in Pasadena, California, [The Bunny Museum](http://www.thebunnymuseum.com/index.html "The Bunny Museum") hosts over 21,000 stuffed, ceramic, plastic, and even living rabbits, and this collection continues to grow daily. It all started on February fourteenth, 1993 when Steve gave Candace a stuffed rabbit, holding a heart with “I Love You This Much” ornately written across it. At first, the couple gave each other bunnies on major holidays, but the excitement of giving each other rabbits was too much to bear. To this day, Steve and Candace exchange rabbit-themed presents, which became the collection it is today.

It’s clear that The Big Lubanski is no ordinary rabbit fan. In 1994, Steve surprised Candace by wearing a human-sized bunny suit to the reception, which featured rabbit-themed decor. This loving couple has opened their 1928 Spanish Stucco bungalow to thousands of people from across the globe. Among the most famous items in the museum is an “Elvis Parsley” rabbit teapot.

Steve Lubanski is a marvelous model that proves that living one’s life is indeed a form of art and self-expression. Lubanski’s fearless love of his lady (and his lagomorphs) can inspire Steves everywhere proudly display what they believe.
