## "cromulent" ##

kram·u·lent; adj.

1. Expression used to legitimize another expression of dubious existence. Used in the ironic sense in that it defends the questionable use of an illigitimate or slang word with another made-up expression. The intent of the phrase is generally used in conjunction with insults to high talkers, english majors and otherwise insufferable people who feel the need to correct others. Often accompanied by a punch to the stomach.
