In an ongoing effort to support , the cliche, yet extremely important, First Ammendment Right to Stickin' it to the Man, The Axis of Stevil would like to salute you:

## STEPHEN COLBERT ##

This week, the Axis of Stevil would like to tip its hat to a man who is not only a writer, comedian, and actor, but savvy news anchor as well.

Every once in a while, on the graph of quality entertainment, the world experiences a spike in such great proportions that it cannot be charted any longer, that is to say until Golden Girls re-runs stop playing on day time television. One of these exotic and interesting spikes has occurred recently, and during this time of uncharted proportions the laughs never stop rolling in. The occurrence of this spike is recently relative to the appearance of one of the most comical Steves in the [history of Steves](/history "history of Steves").

In the humid air of the Charleston Bay, one May, in 1964, there was a slight shift in the earths outer most layer, “Pure-wit”. It was this day that Stephen Colbert emerged from the ashes of dry humor and burst into the scene as a wandering soul of amusement. Upon further development and a Northwestern University diploma in hand, Stephen was off and into the world to spread his expressive wings and fly to the top of pop and political cultural fame, doing stand-up, comedy shows and even **Good Morning America**.

Among his appearances and starring roles on **The Daily Show**, **O’Reilly Factor**, **Strangers with Candy**, and **Whose Line Is It Anyway**, Stephen managed to land his own television show, **The Colbert Report**, and act on the opportunity to illuminate the toon world with the comic light. He also had pleasure of writing and starring in the great, made for Comedy Central television experience, Exit 57.

It is no doubt that Stephen Colbert is one of the greatest comical, cool-headed, witty personalities in this universe today. He has bewitched us with his candy of laughter and handed us the good wrench of satirical politics. The media world is in debt to your service, Mr. Colbert. Keep up the great work!

The Axis of Stevil news desk will maintain a fabric chair with Stephen's name ironed on the back until the end of time. The Axis of Stevil salutes you, Stephen Colbert
