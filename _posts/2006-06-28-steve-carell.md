In an ongoing effort to spread the love, even to inanimate office supplies, The Axis of Stevil gladly gives a 5-Trident salute to **Steve Carrell**!

Steve Carello (original family name) was born August 16th, 1963 in Acton, Massachusetts.  Before starting a career as a performer, Carell was a mail carrier, and at one point, considered going to law school.  In 1991, he began performing with the Chicago troupe of The Second City improve.  He also nabbed his first role in a major motion picture as Tesio in Curly Sue.  Eight years later, Carell became a correspondent on the ever-popular Daily Show.  Until 2004, you could catch Carell in his recurring sketches such as “Even Stephven”, with previous Featured Steve, and arch-nemesis, Stephen Colbert

Steve Carell’s success continues to grow to this day.  He can be found playing the lead role of Michael Scott on NBC’s The Office.  Not only is Carell a star of the television screen, he also has a hefty record of box office triumphs, including Bruce Almighty, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, The 40-Year Old Virgin, Over the Hedge, and is presently working on a sequel to Bruce Almighty entitled Evan Almighty, where Carell returns as Evan Baxter.

In a dog-eat-dog world of Steves in the entertainment business, Steve Carell retains his dignity and makes a name for himself. The Axis of Stevil would like to thank you, Steve Carell, for adding some animation to the seemingly listless worlds of network television and Hollywood motion pictures
