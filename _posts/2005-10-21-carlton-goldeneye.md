It was an intense battle for the Championship of Grand Master of Goldeneye in the Axis of Stevil office. After three rounds of some serious throw-down action, Carlton walked away victorious. The humble Carlton shared no comments about his victory and accepted praise and congratulations from the whole team. After expressing great sportsmanship and shaking hands with Carlton, Steven declared there is "always next time". Carlton then beamed up to his Spaceship with trophy and pride in hand.
