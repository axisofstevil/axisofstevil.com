The perplexing panda propagates the many paradigms of the pragmatic problems of phonics. Not just the penguin of the bear universe, the panda was blessed with a language; that despite its best intention can never quite say the right thing. Among other things, this has caused the retardation of the pandanian courtship process. That can last several years, often fraught with misapprehension and nervousness.

Because of this fact The Axis of Stevil has crafted this handy pocket guide of common panda translations. Keep this in your pocket when traveling through panda country. You will never be caught speechless.
