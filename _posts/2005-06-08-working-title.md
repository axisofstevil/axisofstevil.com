Original thought is a myth propagated by greeting card companies. Well thatâ€™s not exactly true, think about it, when was the last time your heard something entirely original? Humans are a product of their environment. Who you are right at this moment is merely a summation of everything you've seen and done up until now. So how do we keep culture from continually rehashing itself? An easier task would be to wrestle alligators on the moon.
Stare at the above work, let your eyes soften and let the edges blur. Take in all that you see and let your mind tell you something about what you are looking at. Through this exercise you can train your mind to foster better and more creative thoughts. By doing this you can turn the tide of our declining cultural quality.
