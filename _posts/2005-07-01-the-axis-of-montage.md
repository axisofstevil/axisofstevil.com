Ensemble photos are always tricky to do. Between balancing the short and tall people by height and arranging everybody into the photo to be equally captured by the cameras quick-blinking-eye. You will usually end with a jumbled mess of chaotic body parts flailing about the scene. Because of this, these photos are reserved for special occasions such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, Guy Fox Day and the 4th of July.

The above cast photo, taken recently on the back lot of A.O.S. world headquarters, features all of the characters you have grown to love over the past three months. As the weeks go by, some may forget about the great works these characters have been featured in. The Axis of Stevil refuses to relegate its members solely to the archive pages. With the release of this image The Axis of Stevil wishes to honor all of the outstanding work done since its inception into the Local Art Movement and Web-Based Entertainment genre.

Do you consider yourself a Stevil-FANatic? Prove it! Name all of the characters in this scene to enter for a chance to win a free bumper sticker from the Axis of Stevil. Simply download the interactive [Entry Form](http://d3e878vmunx8cm.cloudfront.net/assets/entryform.pdf "Entry Form") and either print, fill in the blanks and mail it in, or type your responses, save and submit it to The Axis of Stevil via [email](/contact "email") or [Art-o-Matic Submission](/ "Art-o-Matic Submission"). All entries must be received by the ***10th of July***.

The Axis of Stevil will be closed on Monday to honor the birth of our great nation. Two hundred and twenty-nine years ago, great men banded together to change the world. Their inspiring words and actions turned thirteen neglected colonies into what is now the greatest nation on earth. All of the signers of the declaration of independence have long been enshrined in the Hall of Honorary Stevil Acknowledgment and their words should continue to guide our fair land:

> "The price of freedom is eternal vigilance."
> -- Thomas Jefferson.

Please, make the most of the long weekend ahead. Enjoy the company of your friends and family, respect the universe and all of its parts and most important of all, be safe! See you next Wednesday!
