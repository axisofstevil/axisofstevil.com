The Axis of Stevil, in a continuing effort to meet and surpass the self-expression needs of the people, offers you a preview of the Upcoming Summer fashion line. Every human being possesses, within them, an Inner fat kid. This plumpy inner child is the force that compels you to deep fry your thanksgiving dinner, or keep a cake by your bedside. The Axis of Stevil will offer this shirt in the summer to all the beach goers, couch potatoes and computer users alike who have come to terms with who they are.
