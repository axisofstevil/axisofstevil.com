The Axis of Stevil is sad to hear the news that a very funny and talented comedian was unjustly taken from this world. His name may not be Steve, but it might as well be. His name will go down in the record books as one of the recipients of the honorary title of "Honorary Steve". The Axis of Stevil is sorry to see this young man leave us so soon. So, having said that . . .

This week, [Axis of Stevil.com](/ "Axis of Stevil.com") salutes you:

## MITCH HEDBERG ##

The [Axis of Stevil](/ "Axis of Stevil") is an organization who creates all of their messages and is in the business of informing, entertaining and helping. However, in this particular case, Mitch Hedburg deserves a really nice send off. [ComedyCentral.com](http://www.comedycentral.com/standup/central/detail.jhtml?p=/comedians/h/mitch_hedberg.xml "ComedyCentral.com") put it the best, with an awesome article and biography of the great, late Mitch hedberg. **ALL CREDIT FOR THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE BELONGS TO THE WRITERS OF COMEDY CENTRAL. IT IS TOO GOOD TO IGNORE**.

> "Tragically, Mitch Hedberg passed away on March 30, 2005. Mitch was a beloved member of the Comedy Central family, and we join with his fans in our sadness. He will be missed.
>
> Born and raised in the St. Paul area, Mitch Hedberg decided to start his own comedy career in South Florida. Not so much for the comedy scene, but for the sun. His landlord would drive him up and down the coast from club to club in his pick-up truck where Mitch would lie down in the back to avoid any of the negative conversations his landlord would try to have with him.
>
> Mitch developed his style in Florida and decided to try it out on different audiences. He moved to Seattle and toured throughout the Pacific Northwest honing his act in front of the new audiences. While in Los Angeles, Mitch booked his first television appearance on MTV's "Comikaze" by walking into the MTV offices and personally pitching himself to the talent coordinator. Many cable shows followed including A&E's "Comedy on the Road," Comedy Central's "Comedy Product," and NBC's "Comedy Showcase" hosted by Louie Anderson.
>
> In 1996, Mitch got his break with an invitation to perform at the prestigious Just for Laughs Montreal International Comedy Festival. His performances secured him a deal with a studio and a spot on "The Late Show with David Letterman." Letterman enjoyed the set so much that he actually quoted one of Mitch's bits later in the show.
>
> Mitch's stand-out performances on the Letterman show (on which he appeared 10 times) and at comedy festivals secured a development deal with FOX to create his own sitcom and prompted TIME magazine to proclaim him "the next Seinfeld" and The Hollywood Reporter to headline their review of the Festival, "Laughs are Loudest for Hedberg."
>
> Mitch Hedberg released two popular comedy CDs, "Strategic Grill Locations" and "Mitch All Together," and he wrote and directed a film, "Las Enchiladas!" which had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.

> Mitch was known for his dry, observational wit and often-mumbled one-liners, and was frequently compared to the comedian Stephen Wright. His reputation as a stoner comic garnered him a cult following among college students. "I used to do drugs. I still do drugs, but I used to do drugs, too," was one of his most famous lines.
> 
> Unlike many comics who shy away from their fans' attention, Mitch welcomed it. His official website encouraged fans to send in pictures of themselves posing with Mitch at his shows. One published anecdote tells of Mitch meeting a group of college students at a recent show in Florida who mentioned the stifling heat of their dorm room. Mitch knocked on their door the next morning with a brand-new air conditioner.
> 
> Mitch Hedberg was popular among his peers and had many friends in the comedy community. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune quoted close friend and comedian Doug Stanhope of The Man Show as saying "He was the greatest comedian ever."
>
> Mitch passed away in March, 2005 at the age of 37."

There will always be a spot for Mitch Hedberg in the Axis of Stevil.
