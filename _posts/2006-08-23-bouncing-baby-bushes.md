[Since World War II](https://d3e878vmunx8cm.cloudfront.net/assets/WW2.jpeg "Since World War II"), The Axis of Stevil has been prone to the slings and arrows of United States’ political commentary, simply because it was considered an “Axis”. Because of this mudslinging, The Axis of Stevil currently keeps several departments dedicated to all political affairs.  These groups toil endlessly while spreading the word on pro-Steve issues and topics that further the interests of Stevlization. In 1971, Grand Stevebar, Garbold Stevenick declared the ‘Every Base Covered' doctrine (EBC). This action mobilized The Axis of Stevil to contentiously plan for every radical change in society. For this effort, The Axis of Stevil is now able to illustrate a pro-Steve message on any issue, to any organization.  The consortium of New Stevil Frontiers was formed in 1974, for the EBC, as a liberal outlet for all Steves. In a recent publication, they encourage the empowering of women.

“Liberal ladies! Throw out you intrauterine devices and fan the winds of change; with your legs! The fertility gap is widening and only the pro-active have the power to stop it! Think to your parent's generation; there were crazed hippies, disco stars, drugs, early child-birth, and seas of progressive thinking. Now, flash forward 30 years and population concerns have the feminist movement eating peanuts out of an elephant’s hand. They’ve been brainwashed into believing that the only civilized choice a woman can make is birth control. Meanwhile, wholesome, Red State families are popping out dozens of God-fearing, American children. Embedded conservative, [Steve Sailer](http://www.isteve.com/ "Steve Sailer") has uncovered these startling findings from the General Social Survey. 

’According to the 2004 GSS, if you picked 100 unrelated politically liberal adults at random, you would find that they had, between them, 147 children. If you picked 100 conservatives, you would find 208 kids. That's a "fertility gap" of 41%. Given that about 80% of people with an identifiable party preference grow up to vote the same way as their parents, this gap translates into lots more little Republicans than little Democrats to vote in future elections.’
        
If Democratic women hope to see the country to better days, they must forsake the conventional wisdom of the modern woman. They must embrace the true freedoms of democracy! Only when utilizing their birthright to sleep around, can enlightened women hope to instill progressive thinking into generations of the future. The opposition isn't backing down. They have rallies where they burn diaphragms, and distribute Enzyte. Republicans even have propaganda, seen above, that states than an increase in numbers is necessary to ensure the safety of the county. Never forget: Republicans won't pull out of **anything**!
