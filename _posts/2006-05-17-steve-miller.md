In an ongoing effort to retrieve nourishment by violently shaking fruits from trees, The Axis of Stevil proudly pays homage to one of the most influential front-Steves in rock and roll history, **Steve Miller**!

Steve Miller was born on October 5th, 1943 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  His family moved and he attended high school at St. Mark’s School of Texas, in Dallas, where he formed his first band named The Marksmen.  A classmate, named Royce Scaggs, wanted to sing and play guitar for the band, which triggered Miller to take Scaggs under his wing.  Little did Miller know that this fellow he was currently teaching would later become a vital part to a future band, as well as a solo career for Royce Scaggs, who is better known today as Boz Scaggs.  This is another shining example of a Steve’s contribution to society and willingness to help others.

In 1968, the legendary Steve Miller Band was formed.  They released their first album Children of the Future, which featured Scaggs as lead vocals.  This first release was deeply rooted in the psychedelic/blues style that dominated the San Francisco music scene at the time.  Scaggs would later leave the band to pursue a solo career, leaving Miller to perform vocals for the band’s future albums.

In 1973, the Steve Miller Band released The Joker, which would become the band’s largest commercial success to date.  This album featured a more pop-oriented and simplistic sound compared to earlier albums, which made the album much more accessible and radio-friendly.  While Miller’s vocal range was limited, his voice still gave the band a unique sound. 

The band would follow up The Joker with Fly Like an Eagle (1976) and Book of Dreams (1977), which both produced its fair share of chart-topping hits including “Rockin’ Me”, “Take the Money and Run”, “Jet Airliner”, and “Jungle Love”. These three highly-successful albums would lead the Steve Miller Band into a major stadium tour with The Eagles in 1977.

Steve Miller is no doubt a pioneer in the on-going pursuit of Stevilation.  In the late 60’s and 70’s, Miller has impacted the world with triumphant high-selling albums containing some of rock history’s catchiest and most recognizable tunes.  Steve Miller continues to inspire Steves, and space cowboys alike, to shoot for the moon.
