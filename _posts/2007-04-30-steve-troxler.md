It’s well known that advancements in science and technology have vastly improved methods of cultivating the world’s produce.  However, The Axis of Stevil considers the best option is one without harsh synthetic chemicals, so that nature is in command.  Farming families have passed down their wisdom since the birth of the nation, and have proven successful in providing the body with essential nutrients and electrolytes. In an ongoing effort to support the America’s beaten backbone, the Axis of Stevil would like to pay homage to **Steve Troxler**!

Some thirty-three years ago, a bright young man, raised in tranquil Browns Summit, NC, earned a Bachelors of Science in conservation at N.C. State University.  That once agronomical amateur is now first Republican Commissioner of Agriculture in North Carolina’s history.

Troxler understood that a position of such regard isn’t earned overnight. Long before being appointed, Troxler founded his own tobacco and wheat farm, as he understood the importance of keeping farming and manufacturing jobs in America. He was, and continues to be, highly involved with the citizens and organizations of Guilford County.  His résumé includes participation with the Board of Directors of North Central Farm Credit Association, the Board of Supervisors of the Guilford County Soil and Water Conservation District, the Guilford County Farmers Organization, Guilford County Extension Advisory Board, Guilford County Farm Bureau. Not to mention, Troxler is founder and president of the Browns Summit-Monticello Youth Association, an organization that provides baseball, softball, basketball, and soccer for the GC youth.

Troxler’s biggest claim to fame is himself.  Since his inauguration as comissh on February 8th, 2005, the 6’5’’ man of the land towers as the largest Commissioner of Agriculture in the United States. In fact, one of his fists is the size of an 11 & 12 Boy’s regulated baseball helmet. When Troxler speaks, everything listens.  The Axis of Stevil finds comfort in knowing that the big man in charge of North Carolina’s produce doesn’t keep his green thumb up where the sun doesn’t shine.
