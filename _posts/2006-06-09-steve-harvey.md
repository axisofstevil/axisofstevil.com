In an ongoing effort to support those who freely speak their mind, The Axis of Stevil would like to salute **Steve Harvey**!

Steven Broderick Harvey was born on January 17th, 1956 in Cleveland, Ohio.  However, the world didn’t know about Harvey until the 1990’s, where he was a continually featured stand-up comedian and host of It’s Showtime at the Apollo. His success at The Apollo inspired the WB television network to give him his own show, The Steve Harvey Show (1996-2002). The show won numerous NAACP Image Awards and was extremely popular within the African-American community.

In order to expand his audience, he teamed up with Cedric the Entertainer, D.L. Hughley, and Bernie Mac, which formed the touring force known as The Kings of Comedy.  With the help of director Spike Lee, the comedy act was released on film under the title The Original Kings of Comedy.

Harvey’s talents don’t stop at comedy.  He has his own record label for up-and-coming hip hop and R&B artists, has authored a book (Steve Harvey’s Big Time), and, as of September 2000, has hosted his own morning radio talk show known as The Steve Harvey Morning Show.

There is no doubt that Steve Harvey is proud to be named “Steve”.  Anything that this media innovator has created proudly displays his name.  The Axis of Stevil would like to thank Steve Harvey in his continuing endeavor in spreading laughter and the 18th most common male moniker.
