In an ongoing effort to promote progress, The Axis of Stevil would like to salute you, **Steve Urkel**!

![Steveurkel1][id_1]

Steve Urkel was a brilliant scholar, inventor, and a connoisseur of fine cheeses. Urkel became a household name on the hit sitcom Family Matters which ran with much success on ABC’s TGIF programming in the early 90’s. His catchy phrases such “Did I do that?” “I don’t have to take this, I’m going home.” and “Got any cheeese?” made him a mildly annoying guy, but lovable nonetheless.

Audiences regularly tuned in for 9 years to watch their favorite geek lust after neighbor Laura, transform himself into Stephan Urkél, and continuously knock over and break things in the Winslow household. Most notably, in Episode 176 entitled Stevil, Steve Urkel creates an evil ventriloquist doll which comes to life. Urkel, the true Steve that he is, ultimately conquers his nemesis with his master wit and courageously saves the day.

There will always be a block of cheese here for Steve Urkel in the [Axis of Stevil](/ "Axis of Stevil").
