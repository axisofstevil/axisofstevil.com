Steven Soderbergh was born in Atlanta, Georgia on January 14th, 1963 to parents of Swedish descent.  His family later moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father was appointed dean of education at Louisiana State University.  As a teenager, Steven borrowed film equipment from LSU students to direct and shoot short films.  Rather than attending LSU, Steven moved to Hollywood after graduating high school.  He worked numerous crew jobs until his first big break His came when he directed Yes’s Grammy-nominated 9012 Live concert video in 1985.

Four years later, Steven wrote, directed, and edited 1989’s sex, lies, and video tape.  This film, among others, sparked the independent film revolution of the 1990’s and went on to win an illustrious Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival.  After his sudden worldwide commercial success, Steven was dubbed the “poster boy of the Sundance generation”.

The trophies didn’t stop there.  Steven Soderbergh won an Academy Award for Best Director for his outstanding social drama Traffic (2000).  Like any kind-hearted Steve, Soderbergh shared the wealth after directing Julia Roberts (Erin Brockovich, 2000) and Benicio Del Toro (Traffic) to Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor wins, respectively. The next year, Steven directed Ocean’s Eleven, which raked in over $183 million and sparked two sequels. While Soderbergh’s films are known for their ensemble casts, his 2006 work, Bubble, features a nonprofessional cast.  Be it George Clooney, or George down the street, Steven Soderbergh can take a movie and make it Out of Sight.
