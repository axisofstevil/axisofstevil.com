All great Steves think alike and when two or more Steve’s get together, magic happens. Steves also understand the importance of education in order to improve life for future generations.  Modesty is a trait these exemplary individuals all share, and so we salute the second Steve behind the forbidden fruit, **Steven Wozniak**!

In sunny San Jose, California on August 11, 1950, the world gained a future inventor and humanitarian in Stephan Gary Wozniak.  In high school, he would befriend a fellow Featured Steve, Steve Jobs.  In 1975, after selling prized possessions, the dynamic dyad was able to develop the Apple I, which was far beyond its competition, the Altair 8800.  A year later, the Steves formed Apple Computer and began selling computers to local dealers.  The rest, as they say, is history.

While Steve Wozniak is best known for his impact in personal computers, he is also an award-winning philanthropist.  After his success with Apple Computers, he taught fifth grade students and earned honorary Doctor of Science and Engineering degrees from North Carolina State University, Nova Southeastern University, and Kettering University, respectively. He was also recognized through his contributions to [San Jose's Children's Discovery Museum](http://www.cdm.org/ "San Jose's Children's Discovery Museum").  There’s no doubt about it; Steve Wozniak is one of the best Steves there ever Woz.
