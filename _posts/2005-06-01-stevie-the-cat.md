## STEVIE THE CAT ##

![Steviethecat1][id_1]

Stevie the cat, also know to some as the Great Toilet Bowl philosopher is one of the greatest feline minds of today. Adopted by a college student as a kitten in Greenville NC, he was later that day was given the great name of Stevie. After partying one morning, Stevie woke up with a hangover and after drinking from a toilet came up with his most famous bit of wisdom…”Look before you lap.” Mario Kart enthusiasts later adopted this saying as their mantra and teach a “look before you lap” seminar annually.

Later that year he successfully mixed wet and dry cat food selling it exclusively to Mom ‘n Pop’s grocery stores across the southeast. A combination of fame and living with college students lead to an early cat nip dependency. After rehab, Stevie was rumored to be dating Chaka Kahn; however neither party will confirm or deny the affair. Today Stevie relaxes by observing the mating habits of dogs and birds; noting their inferior intelligence. Stevie is a legend among cat and man and we at the Axis of Stevil salute him for being an extraordinary feline.

There will always be a ball of yarn here for Stevie the Cat in the [Axis of Stevil](/ "Axis of Stevil").
