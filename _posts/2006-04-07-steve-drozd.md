In the honorable tradition of musical success and dignity, The Axis of Stevil would like to spread the word about a great and talented Steve, **Steve Drozd**!

The power to create music is a gift not bestowed upon just anyone. Many people wander through life with no sense of the true power of music.  Steven Drozd, or the "musical brains behind The Flaming Lips", harnessed the tremendous power of Stevilzation to propel his musical talents into ethereal ranges known only by the greats.

Steven Drozd started his journey as a small boy in Houston Texas. Being part of a family of musicians caused his young mind to be crammed with primal rhythms. The drums of the universe beat strong within the back of his brain. When he was ten he got his first drum kit and it was on like Donkey Kong. After only a short time, Steve was totally proficient and began playing in his father’s band, Vernon Drozd's Polka Band.

During the many days and nights Steven spent with the band, Steven trained on the piano under Harold 'Stinky Fingers' Samules. Stinky Fingers had spent a decade touring the Southwest and was known for his legendary jazz improvisations and his unwashed hands. Samules had long thought to wash his hands would strip them of their talents, so he never did. By the age of 12, Steven had mastered the piano, but at a price. His constant exposure to an extreme odor, that was ten times worse then any hippie, damaged 45% of his olfactory abilities. 

After Steven finished high school, he boldly followed the sweet mistress of music and moved to Oklahoma City, where he worked with several different bands. He was looking for a band that harnessed melody and sound for the betterment of the soul, and was fearless and willing to constantly experiment.  In 1992, Drozd collided with The Flaming Lips and the connection was instantaneous. He quickly abandoned his pet project, Drozd and the Jerk Chicken Experience, and signed on with The Flaming Lips as the new drummer. It didn't stop there. The creative and open nature of The Flaming Lips allowed him to finally realize the musical atmospheres that had long been swirling in his head. 

In the summer of 1997, Steve had a dream in which he saw his band being destroyed in a fiery explosion brought about by a shadowy group of Thought Police. The visions disturbed him so much, that he left the band for two months to find himself. He journeyed into the Canadian Yukon on a spiritual quest. It was here, within the quietude of the frozen forests that Steve communed with a pure being of Stevilization. This creature gave Drozd a pair of drumsticks that increased his Stevilization threshold one hundred fold.

Awakened and energized, Steven returned to the band and performed most of the music for the band’s critically lauded 'The Soft Bullet'. Since his Yukon experience, Steve has had the ability to pick up and play any musical instrument, allowing him, and the band, to grow in new directions every day. 

Steven has continued to develop the musical sounds and experimentation of The Flaming Lips.

Steve Drozd is the living fusion of music and Stevilization. He is another fine example of actualizing on your full potential of self.
