*It is written, behind every evil-billy goat eating-Troll, there is a crack team of accountants working diligently around the clock to keep a murderous trollâ€™s finances in order. Trolls and other ancient races are considered exempt from the laws of man. Thusly, any Deaths or Property Damage caused by trolls attacks leave victims with little recourse beyond filling an insurance claim.* 

*To keep track of all their plundering and help them plan for the future, Trolls keep in their entourage only the best of CPAs.*
