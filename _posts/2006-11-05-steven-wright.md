In an ongoing effort to bring harmony between from all walks of life, be it doctors, radio disc jockeys, or even that guy on the couch, The Axis of Stevil is “Mad About... *Steve Wright **"!

Steven Wright was born in New York, New York, on December 6th, 1955, Steven Wright.  His childhood was spent in Burlington, Massachusetts, which was home to other professional entertainers, such as SNL’s Amy Poehler and David Lovering of the Pixies. 

He began doing stand-up comedy in 1978.  He was known for his trademark monotone delivery of material ranging from completely inane to practically philosophical.  By 1985, he was bumping elbows (and who knows what else) with Madonna in the cast of Desperately Seeking Susan.  The same year, he released a Grammy Nominated comedy album entitled I Have a Pony.  What he couldn’t win in music, he nabbed in the 1989 Academy Awards when The Appointments of Dennis Jennings, which he co-wrote and starred in, won the Oscar for Best Live-Action Short Film.  Steven Wright added even more notches in his acting belt in the 1990s, including Reservoir Dogs (1992), So I Married an Axe Murderer (1993), Natural Born Killers (1994), and Canadian Bacon (1995).

The Axis of Stevil believes that Steven Wright is a salient symbol of Stevilization for all ages. While older generations remember Steven Wright for his stand-up comedy (which he still does to this day), the younger populous tends to recognize him from his brilliant acting role in Half-Baked. Wright is also reaching out to new fans with his television special Steven Wright: When the Leaves Blow Away. Either way you slice it, Steven Wright fits snuggly in all of our hearts and funny bones.
