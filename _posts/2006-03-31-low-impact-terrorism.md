In recent weeks The Axis of Stevil has noticed an increase in the level of terrorist chatter. Several creditable threats in the form of magazine order cards have been intercepted that show a swelling of entry-level terrorist support. Be aware of low impact terrorist organizations that seek to draw upon the sympathies of evil and unmotivated men. The following press release was found in a raid of a terrorist compound outside of Jamestown, MA.

> Have you ever felt like the world is too organized? Too mapped out? Too many rules and too little defiance? Where are the unsung heroes that put the real in reality? This self-awareness has put you in the right direction to finding answers to these questions.

> Terrorism is not always the worst thing on the menu; it can come in all shapes and flavors. One might say that a terrorist is like a beautiful snowflake; unique in its design and appearance. Terrorists devote their entire lives to a cause; forsaking everything for the belief in an idea that is unaccepted by the democracy. Whether you choose to be an extremist or just part of the passive resistance, it can be difficult to commit the time that is required by particular ideas. A strong terrorist group is a thousand times needier than and thrice as bitchy as any high malignance girlfriend. So if you can’t be a true believer, go for the next best thing: Low Impact Terrorism!

> Low Impact Terrorism isn’t just about filling your return-mailer envelope with scrap paper and mailing it back to the spammer. It is not just about the satisfaction of putting a knot in the democratic system. Low Impact Terrorism is a brotherhood among those who seek to put the real in reality; those who share the same beliefs in turning against the tide and pushing hard.

> You no longer have to go on unsung. Join a local chapter of Low impact Terrorism. Let your voice be heard.

Like most armchair evildoers and posers, the part time terrorist has little resolve. In fact he will quickly turn coat and return to the side of good with just a little shock and awe. With this in mind, The Axis of Stevil has started a crack squadron of mercenaries, stuntman and rouge Hollywood producers who have been tasked to combat low impact terrorism from coast to coast. These masters of Green screens, ammunition blanks and stunt ramps will crash a ‘76 thunderbird through a 3rd story office window and spray blanks from a Armalite M16, all while pyrotechnic explosions shimmer through the falling pieces of glass. This theatrical display is guaranteed to terrify even the most stone-faced cooperate slime bag straight. Fighting small time domestic terrorism with big budget action terror is the way of the new century.
